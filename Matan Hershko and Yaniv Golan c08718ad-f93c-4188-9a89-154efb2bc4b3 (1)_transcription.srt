1
00:00:19,765 --> 00:00:19,905
Speaker1: you

2
00:00:19,905 --> 00:00:20,005
Speaker2: Hello.

3
00:00:20,005 --> 00:00:20,225
Speaker1: you

4
00:00:21,685 --> 00:00:22,445
Speaker1: Okay.

5
00:00:23,745 --> 00:00:27,225
Speaker2: wow

6
00:00:27,985 --> 00:00:29,545
Speaker1: I don't know.

7
00:00:30,225 --> 00:00:40,925
Speaker2: um

8
00:00:41,465 --> 00:00:42,325
Speaker2: Yeah.

9
00:00:42,505 --> 00:00:44,245
Speaker1: Microsoft, by Zoom or by Teams?

10
00:00:44,605 --> 00:00:45,745
Speaker2: The Thames.

11
00:00:45,745 --> 00:00:47,345
Speaker1: Yeah, it takes a little bit.

12
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:55,205
Speaker2: That's right. So it's also very impressive, right? Big companies and foundations that can't afford to raise a product that's already being raised.

13
00:00:56,885 --> 00:00:59,625
Speaker1: And I thought, well, I'm not going to go out there.

14
00:00:59,725 --> 00:01:00,485
Speaker2: No, no.

15
00:01:00,885 --> 00:01:04,745
Speaker2: What was the experience? I just want to ask you in the video

16
00:01:02,945 --> 00:01:03,125
Speaker1: It's like the ocean of life.

17
00:01:05,225 --> 00:01:07,085
Speaker1: Yeah.

18
00:01:07,705 --> 00:01:11,605
Speaker1: foreign

19
00:01:12,805 --> 00:01:20,185
Speaker1: um

20
00:01:20,485 --> 00:01:23,585
Speaker1: Okay.

21
00:01:24,205 --> 00:01:28,505
Speaker1: foreign

22
00:01:28,845 --> 00:01:29,665
Speaker1: Bowser.

23
00:01:29,045 --> 00:01:29,585
Speaker2: you

24
00:01:29,665 --> 00:01:29,765
Speaker2: you

25
00:01:30,445 --> 00:01:30,845
Speaker1: you

26
00:01:30,625 --> 00:01:32,405
Speaker2: Yes.

27
00:01:32,865 --> 00:01:33,605
Speaker1: No.

28
00:01:34,025 --> 00:01:40,005
Speaker2: Okay, okay. Interesting. Especially since the browser is Chrome and not Edge, so it's not that different.

29
00:01:35,405 --> 00:01:35,425
Speaker1: you

30
00:01:40,565 --> 00:01:43,685
Speaker1: Shanim Shatiskuld Zamaskanabentayim.

31
00:01:43,685 --> 00:01:43,825
Speaker2: you

32
00:01:44,865 --> 00:01:45,565
Speaker2: Okay.

33
00:01:45,005 --> 00:01:45,445
Speaker1: you

34
00:01:45,565 --> 00:01:46,045
Speaker1: with help.

35
00:01:46,705 --> 00:01:47,805
Speaker2: So,

36
00:01:48,825 --> 00:01:50,905
Speaker1: .

37
00:01:50,905 --> 00:01:51,425
Speaker2: about on the phone.

38
00:01:52,265 --> 00:01:53,065
Speaker2: Each time would be a month.

39
00:01:52,405 --> 00:01:52,925
Speaker1: you

40
00:01:53,785 --> 00:01:54,565
Speaker1: Yeah.

41
00:01:55,045 --> 00:01:55,565
Speaker1: you

42
00:01:55,245 --> 00:02:00,065
Speaker2: I wanted to have a long conversation with him last week, and...

43
00:02:00,405 --> 00:02:08,065
Speaker2: She does it perfectly.

44
00:02:06,985 --> 00:02:07,885
Speaker1: the

45
00:02:08,385 --> 00:02:09,785
Speaker1: My match.

46
00:02:08,525 --> 00:02:08,965
Speaker2: you

47
00:02:10,105 --> 00:02:23,985
Speaker2: Yeah.

48
00:02:24,265 --> 00:02:34,785
Speaker2: And I think that it gives more of a specific benefit to this role, most of the skills and capabilities, and we see the impact behind it.

49
00:02:35,505 --> 00:02:39,205
Speaker1: foreign

50
00:02:39,525 --> 00:02:40,005
Speaker1: Thank you.

51
00:02:40,005 --> 00:02:55,445
Speaker2: Right.

52
00:02:56,045 --> 00:02:58,765
Speaker2: Yes.

53
00:02:59,545 --> 00:03:03,065
Speaker1: um

54
00:03:03,385 --> 00:03:05,205
Speaker1: No, it's not easy to manipulate them, not as long as

55
00:03:05,865 --> 00:03:09,065
Speaker1: um

56
00:03:09,325 --> 00:03:11,065
Speaker1: and to be involved in the political game.

57
00:03:11,345 --> 00:03:20,505
Speaker2: Yeah.

58
00:03:20,785 --> 00:03:36,045
Speaker2: um

59
00:03:36,405 --> 00:03:40,245
Speaker2: um

60
00:03:40,945 --> 00:03:42,705
Speaker1: I think it's the first time.

61
00:03:43,065 --> 00:03:43,965
Speaker1: you

62
00:03:43,485 --> 00:03:43,725
Speaker2: you

63
00:03:44,165 --> 00:03:54,025
Speaker2: So I did it in 8.1, I was a senior at the age of 26, and I was there with 30 people. And in the second job at Vectorius, I worked at the Thor's Medical Devices, and I was there for six years.

64
00:03:54,045 --> 00:03:57,105
Speaker2: So I started alone, but I realized there are 40 people in your house.

65
00:03:57,265 --> 00:04:13,025
Speaker2: um

66
00:04:13,345 --> 00:04:24,565
Speaker2: Yeah.

67
00:04:24,885 --> 00:04:29,125
Speaker2: And you still see the interaction between people. You say, okay, great, something good happened here.

68
00:04:29,505 --> 00:04:30,225
Speaker2: Exactly.

69
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:31,085
Speaker1: It's all that we should be thinking about.

70
00:04:31,085 --> 00:04:33,345
Speaker2: Ken, Ken, the Trojano guy from South Africa.

71
00:04:33,645 --> 00:04:35,425
Speaker1: Okay, so how many people will you bring to MLB?

72
00:04:35,845 --> 00:04:46,205
Speaker2: Yeah.

73
00:04:46,585 --> 00:04:48,325
Speaker2: But

74
00:04:49,065 --> 00:04:55,245
Speaker2: on

75
00:04:56,545 --> 00:05:05,645
Speaker2: .

76
00:05:06,045 --> 00:05:10,705
Speaker2: .

77
00:05:11,265 --> 00:05:16,365
Speaker2: So there's some kind of convergence point that can be done to change the process.

78
00:05:16,685 --> 00:05:21,085
Speaker2: When I don't offer a service, the thing about CRO exists, it's a real thing,

79
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:28,765
Speaker2: The complex point is that it is not observable, not controllable, and it is also not

80
00:05:29,685 --> 00:05:37,725
Speaker2: is

81
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:46,505
Speaker2: um

82
00:05:47,005 --> 00:05:56,305
Speaker2: He's in the end, he's in the end, yes, no, less than him. He doesn't know what's going on inside of him. He can't change the course of things. He can't change the course of things. Just to stop the time, he's a big idiot.

83
00:05:56,765 --> 00:05:59,525
Speaker2: So both of them have less service and it's not a good idea.

84
00:05:59,885 --> 00:06:01,005
Speaker2: focuses. Um,

85
00:06:01,485 --> 00:06:12,625
Speaker2: And that's where the point of automation can change. It can create a much more reliable, transparent system, easy to use, easy to sell at the price, to do a lot of selling,

86
00:06:12,985 --> 00:06:18,425
Speaker2: It's actually very similar to the model that six countries work today, in this way.

87
00:06:18,805 --> 00:06:20,445
Speaker2: I'm just going to

88
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:38,105
Speaker2: So at the end, I invite Emil Barri as a great company that changes the game laws of Dacres Biology R&D, because product discovery is one section, food tech is another, tissue engineering is another, all these things we put on the same small basis.

89
00:06:38,245 --> 00:06:40,325
Speaker2: to share the set credentials, this is what I

90
00:06:40,845 --> 00:06:41,685
Speaker1: level.

91
00:06:41,945 --> 00:06:42,645
Speaker2: I'm not sure.

92
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:43,485
Speaker1: you

93
00:06:43,845 --> 00:06:51,605
Speaker2: Yeah.

94
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:53,765
Speaker2: Uh,

95
00:06:54,145 --> 00:06:59,625
Speaker2: So this is how we see MLBio in the next decade.

96
00:07:00,085 --> 00:07:13,605
Speaker2: um

97
00:07:13,925 --> 00:07:18,645
Speaker2: credits. So, yeah, it's great, and you can make decisions, and you can make the ability to

98
00:07:19,485 --> 00:07:25,785
Speaker2: um

99
00:07:26,225 --> 00:07:27,285
Speaker2: There.

100
00:07:27,845 --> 00:07:33,045
Speaker1: So what's the way you're going to change the game rules? What's the breakthrough you're going to make?

101
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:46,325
Speaker2: Right.

102
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:52,345
Speaker2: something that in most areas sounds a bit strange, because people think that automation is a big deal,

103
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:59,905
Speaker2: um

104
00:08:00,365 --> 00:08:01,505
Speaker2: Uh,

105
00:08:02,005 --> 00:08:16,205
Speaker2: And I built also commercial, software and procedural infrastructure.

106
00:08:16,525 --> 00:08:25,485
Speaker2: which will enable a significant reduction of automation time and increase reliability and the ability of the users and the customer to

107
00:08:25,825 --> 00:08:27,725
Speaker2: There's power in that

108
00:08:28,085 --> 00:08:35,745
Speaker2: Israel.

109
00:08:36,025 --> 00:08:45,805
Speaker2: which is called payload, because they have a field that sits in the air and is controlled by blood pressure at the left altitude, exactly 0.1 mm2, which is what

110
00:08:46,165 --> 00:08:49,165
Speaker2: uh

111
00:08:49,345 --> 00:08:58,685
Speaker2: um

112
00:08:58,805 --> 00:09:04,625
Speaker2: But to make it possible, there's the non-product development. We created an automation system

113
00:09:04,985 --> 00:09:08,065
Speaker2: shlema, kdei levatzea ta kiul, ta bedikot, ta nachkarim

114
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:11,645
Speaker2: Now, that's a lot of things that...

115
00:09:12,025 --> 00:09:19,345
Speaker2: And just as an anecdote, when I got to the company, I was an 8-year-old worker. They tried to raise an automation system, it was like 90 million dollars a piece.

116
00:09:19,605 --> 00:09:26,165
Speaker2: A month later, I bought an automatic machine that was $1,200 a piece, and instead of $4, it was $10.

117
00:09:26,405 --> 00:09:29,825
Speaker2: But long as they're not as cannibalist, I mean, the whole idea of being a

118
00:09:30,165 --> 00:09:33,825
Speaker2: .

119
00:09:34,185 --> 00:09:37,265
Speaker2: .

120
00:09:38,425 --> 00:09:40,745
Speaker2: I think less than a second.

121
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:47,765
Speaker2: um

122
00:09:48,145 --> 00:09:57,065
Speaker2: So that's what I did in the past, and that's the component I'm going to do now in MLBio. That is, to re-evaluate, and here I also put a lot of my cooperation as a barrier into the process.

123
00:09:57,365 --> 00:10:01,325
Speaker2: l'inconvenient a b'nei b'nei b'nei b'nei b'nei b'nei b'nei b'nei b'nei b'nei b'nei b'nei

124
00:10:01,405 --> 00:10:09,585
Speaker2: and instead of doing what everyone is doing right now, which is instead of a head with one head, a head with four, an eight, and a head with a head with a head,

125
00:10:10,145 --> 00:10:15,765
Speaker2: To waste a lot of time, to think again about the movement itself that we need to do and to perform it in a different way.

126
00:10:16,105 --> 00:10:24,065
Speaker2: I can think of processes where I wrote a provision on the relevant concepts that allow for recognition. I didn't find a patent on this nature.

127
00:10:24,405 --> 00:10:27,065
Speaker2: And that means that we can also start from this point.

128
00:10:27,565 --> 00:10:28,965
Speaker2: Uh,

129
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:32,605
Speaker2: So that's how we're going to do it. We'll give you an hour.

130
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:42,745
Speaker2: .

131
00:10:43,245 --> 00:10:48,845
Speaker2: and a lot of the core is also based on what is called the relationship system between the white and the white, which we know from

132
00:10:49,165 --> 00:10:53,545
Speaker2: if I was very strong in the electronic field, I would be very strong in the bio field,

133
00:10:53,865 --> 00:10:58,965
Speaker2: Paz Akzara, in 82, who was there for three years and won the Israel Security Council.

134
00:10:59,385 --> 00:11:00,665
Speaker2: Uh,

135
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:12,205
Speaker2: DNA, food tech, medical devices, pharma,

136
00:11:12,545 --> 00:11:13,725
Speaker2: Colm O'Connor.

137
00:11:13,865 --> 00:11:21,705
Speaker2: um

138
00:11:22,065 --> 00:11:27,665
Speaker2: and I can be a good candidate. Because that's what always leads to the product and makes the conversations with the biologists

139
00:11:27,985 --> 00:11:32,525
Speaker2: and I'm on the side of the, to release those people

140
00:11:40,765 --> 00:11:42,845
Speaker1: Okay.

141
00:11:44,185 --> 00:11:45,505
Speaker1: .

142
00:11:46,525 --> 00:11:53,745
Speaker2: .

143
00:11:54,025 --> 00:12:20,985
Speaker2: foreign

144
00:12:21,205 --> 00:12:27,205
Speaker2: um

145
00:12:27,785 --> 00:12:32,505
Speaker2: Yeah.

146
00:12:32,925 --> 00:12:34,945
Speaker2: Right.

147
00:12:35,345 --> 00:12:44,765
Speaker2: um

148
00:12:45,105 --> 00:12:51,365
Speaker2: foreign

149
00:12:51,585 --> 00:12:53,365
Speaker2: Shalom.

150
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:55,705
Speaker1: I'll raise my hand.

151
00:12:53,605 --> 00:12:53,745
Speaker2: you

152
00:12:56,785 --> 00:12:59,785
Speaker1: .

153
00:13:00,245 --> 00:13:01,105
Speaker2: Bioraptor?

154
00:13:01,505 --> 00:13:01,965
Speaker1: you

155
00:13:02,025 --> 00:13:02,545
Speaker2: you

156
00:13:03,485 --> 00:13:07,025
Speaker1: competitive

157
00:13:07,525 --> 00:13:08,585
Speaker2: No, it's

158
00:13:07,825 --> 00:13:08,005
Speaker1: No, it's

159
00:13:08,825 --> 00:13:10,125
Speaker1: Yes.

160
00:13:10,745 --> 00:13:12,525
Speaker1: foreign

161
00:13:12,085 --> 00:13:12,745
Speaker2: you

162
00:13:12,885 --> 00:13:14,225
Speaker1: Yeah.

163
00:13:14,445 --> 00:13:14,965
Speaker2: you

164
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:15,145
Speaker2: you

165
00:13:15,145 --> 00:13:20,085
Speaker1: One of their capabilities is to identify earlier where the experiment is going.

166
00:13:15,225 --> 00:13:15,765
Speaker2: you

167
00:13:20,325 --> 00:13:25,645
Speaker2: מדהים. זה כל כך סופר חשוב. דבר שני, לדעתי זה שונה. אני אסביר

168
00:13:26,165 --> 00:13:30,785
Speaker2: Because, first of all, I think it's important to look at the future and say,

169
00:13:31,245 --> 00:13:38,965
Speaker2: um

170
00:13:39,425 --> 00:13:46,465
Speaker2: So in Maccabra 24-7 on cell cultures, the maintenance, the processing, just blocks.

171
00:13:46,685 --> 00:13:49,445
Speaker2: Yeah.

172
00:13:47,465 --> 00:13:47,625
Speaker1: you

173
00:13:50,325 --> 00:13:51,165
Speaker2: Yeah.

174
00:13:52,685 --> 00:13:53,605
Speaker2: Bye-bye.

175
00:13:53,985 --> 00:14:08,885
Speaker2: Right.

176
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:18,425
Speaker2: And there's a lot of things that I see in general, that there's a lot of potential for cooperation, and other analysis capabilities that have been developed in other places,

177
00:14:18,725 --> 00:14:20,685
Speaker2: or

178
00:14:21,345 --> 00:14:23,805
Speaker2: or other capabilities of

179
00:14:24,085 --> 00:14:34,545
Speaker2: um

180
00:14:35,105 --> 00:14:42,045
Speaker1: Yeah.

181
00:14:42,365 --> 00:14:49,665
Speaker2: I don't either. I just believe that it could be. There are changes in business that are not in cooperation. There is cooperation for the shop, it's always possible, but it

182
00:14:49,985 --> 00:15:00,245
Speaker2: .

183
00:15:00,785 --> 00:15:01,145
Speaker1: me.

184
00:15:01,585 --> 00:15:02,505
Speaker1: Yeah.

185
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:10,165
Speaker1: .

186
00:15:10,465 --> 00:15:17,925
Speaker1: So how is it, Borgen Damien, I understand that you're still at the validation stage, but Borgen Damien, what does the process look like in your world? What are the

187
00:15:18,305 --> 00:15:20,445
Speaker1: foreign

188
00:15:20,925 --> 00:15:21,965
Speaker2: on the

189
00:15:22,285 --> 00:15:26,925
Speaker2: I don't know if it can help, maybe I have the spirit of a customer, John,

190
00:15:27,225 --> 00:15:29,945
Speaker2: um

191
00:15:30,305 --> 00:15:32,665
Speaker1: .

192
00:15:32,885 --> 00:15:34,845
Speaker1: the

193
00:15:35,065 --> 00:15:37,185
Speaker2: I knew

194
00:15:36,465 --> 00:15:38,245
Speaker1: I knew.

195
00:15:38,245 --> 00:15:40,905
Speaker2: Okay.

196
00:15:40,905 --> 00:15:43,145
Speaker1: But the format of the particular telephone.

197
00:15:43,365 --> 00:15:48,845
Speaker2: No, no, it's something you said in a strange way in the science section.

198
00:15:49,105 --> 00:15:57,705
Speaker2: is

199
00:15:58,865 --> 00:16:02,285
Speaker1: .

200
00:16:02,645 --> 00:16:03,665
Speaker2: Ah.

201
00:16:05,645 --> 00:16:06,925
Speaker2: Okay.

202
00:16:09,525 --> 00:16:10,725
Speaker2: Yeah.

203
00:16:11,525 --> 00:16:12,825
Speaker2: Good.

204
00:16:13,185 --> 00:16:16,805
Speaker2: Yeah.

205
00:16:16,805 --> 00:16:18,185
Speaker1: um

206
00:16:18,545 --> 00:16:18,625
Speaker1: you

207
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:20,305
Speaker2: Right.

208
00:16:20,685 --> 00:16:25,765
Speaker2: So we're talking right from the start about how to do the...

209
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:31,585
Speaker2: with

210
00:16:31,985 --> 00:16:39,385
Speaker2: um

211
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:43,225
Speaker1: .

212
00:16:40,445 --> 00:16:40,785
Speaker2: you

213
00:16:42,985 --> 00:16:53,285
Speaker2: No, no, no. On-prem, it will be a very, very specific situation. I mean, I assume that large pharma companies and large hospitals will want it on-prem, but otherwise

214
00:16:53,845 --> 00:16:57,405
Speaker1: um

215
00:16:57,765 --> 00:17:05,605
Speaker2: I see it as a good thing in the billing. That is, the solution itself will be the same solution, but I'm going to have to put much more money to companies that do

216
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:07,345
Speaker1: Okay.

217
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:11,565
Speaker2: um

218
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:15,405
Speaker2: um

219
00:17:15,705 --> 00:17:23,205
Speaker2: We get it automatically to a dispenser, which allows the distribution of the cells into something that looks like a bioserver.

220
00:17:23,365 --> 00:17:37,125
Speaker2: and divides the cells in a relevant way. The cells are constantly depleted because the original system of cells allows maintenance to the cells and allows them to live in a regular way. Already about 20% of the work is in biological works and the main source of pollution.

221
00:17:37,305 --> 00:17:46,285
Speaker2: which are about 30% of the cases, and the worst thing is that they are done at random. So there are companies that have signed a half-year-old ban.

222
00:17:46,645 --> 00:17:50,305
Speaker2: NetRig Al-Zium, which is basically the carpet for the incubator,

223
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:55,365
Speaker2: and there are other companies that just, like, in a regular way, they're with two months a year.

224
00:17:55,385 --> 00:17:56,685
Speaker2: No.

225
00:17:56,805 --> 00:17:58,225
Speaker1: And why is it your opinion?

226
00:17:58,665 --> 00:18:00,685
Speaker2: Help me, Adam. Help me, Adam.

227
00:18:01,445 --> 00:18:01,945
Speaker1: you

228
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:15,465
Speaker2: So basically, we have a system like this, and we allow the researcher to regularly, 24-7, to view and be able to evaluate the experiment, which allows him to guide exactly like the rest of the laboratory.

229
00:18:15,785 --> 00:18:21,145
Speaker2: Shalom.

230
00:18:21,345 --> 00:18:24,945
Speaker2: Temperatural or whatever, you know, it's both and then.

231
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:27,745
Speaker2: Mashigam.

232
00:18:28,165 --> 00:18:30,685
Speaker2: And in the end, we're going to have

233
00:18:30,105 --> 00:18:34,825
Speaker1: um

234
00:18:35,145 --> 00:18:39,405
Speaker2: I can, and as soon as I do it, I'll expose it to the

235
00:18:39,725 --> 00:18:46,065
Speaker2: You think that the situation I'm in is 24-7, I can go and fight it. And every time I go out, the destruction is actually a piece of the plan.

236
00:18:46,465 --> 00:18:55,645
Speaker2: So, it's a bit more convenient. The process in which I take a sample of the status in the brain, is I take my plastic or my multi-weather, I put it in my brain.

237
00:18:54,785 --> 00:18:58,945
Speaker1: um

238
00:18:59,145 --> 00:19:26,585
Speaker2: or

239
00:19:26,905 --> 00:19:28,265
Speaker2: Okay.

240
00:19:27,165 --> 00:19:34,185
Speaker1: So why can you do it without robotic sound? How do you do it without having to use this high-tech technology?

241
00:19:34,505 --> 00:19:50,645
Speaker2: .

242
00:19:52,965 --> 00:19:53,305
Speaker1: .

243
00:19:54,005 --> 00:20:01,165
Speaker2: And that's true for all the solutions we've seen, except for one that was really cool, which uses lasers.

244
00:20:01,485 --> 00:20:05,765
Speaker2: um

245
00:20:06,145 --> 00:20:11,765
Speaker2: to very specific things. To single-cell manipulation and not to things that require

246
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:13,045
Speaker2: about anything fit.

247
00:20:13,905 --> 00:20:14,985
Speaker2: Yeah.

248
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:14,165
Speaker1: you

249
00:20:15,545 --> 00:20:18,125
Speaker2: as... I can say what she did, really.

250
00:20:17,465 --> 00:20:17,725
Speaker1: you

251
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:22,165
Speaker1: It's a flexibility that I have

252
00:20:22,265 --> 00:20:25,645
Speaker1: .

253
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:29,185
Speaker1: .

254
00:20:29,725 --> 00:20:30,285
Speaker1: plan

255
00:20:30,745 --> 00:20:42,305
Speaker2: So part of the point is that, this is the interesting part of the story, because the basic building blocks, which allows you to move minimally, which is basically the inspection and control of the users in a certain way,

256
00:20:42,725 --> 00:20:56,765
Speaker2: um

257
00:20:57,085 --> 00:20:58,085
Speaker2: This is a hot...

258
00:20:58,505 --> 00:21:03,785
Speaker2: Yesh Deir Echad, to check the reality, that what we're saying is that it's constantly being opposed to the end of the spectrum,

259
00:21:04,045 --> 00:21:08,945
Speaker2: foreign

260
00:21:09,305 --> 00:21:20,665
Speaker2: So there's a way of rethinking of things. If we're going to make a long-term, we're all going to use centrifugal methods to make a lot of fat. And there are many ways to do that. We're going to do it in a different way, which is more scalable, more flexible, more

261
00:21:20,765 --> 00:21:25,825
Speaker2: So there's an issue here, not necessarily of another kind of development, but of a digital development.

262
00:21:25,865 --> 00:21:28,905
Speaker2: And that's also one of the reasons we want to present it as

263
00:21:29,105 --> 00:21:34,065
Speaker2: We want to put a screen of the glass of ice in front of the researchers and say, listen, we want you to guess

264
00:21:34,365 --> 00:21:38,645
Speaker2: um

265
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:42,145
Speaker2: And it's less important to them how we do it.

266
00:21:42,365 --> 00:21:49,105
Speaker2: And it's really something that we've seen, because we're really interested in validation. For example, we talked to Dan Dominesoni from Shiba, if you know him by chance.

267
00:21:49,485 --> 00:21:51,165
Speaker2: uh

268
00:21:51,705 --> 00:22:00,045
Speaker2: It was an amazing conversation. It was a really fun conversation. We have a continuation of the conversation. If you want to sign up for our cooperation, we have conversations with them.

269
00:22:00,405 --> 00:22:02,065
Speaker2: and the design problems

270
00:22:02,365 --> 00:22:05,265
Speaker2: And they're like,

271
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:14,085
Speaker2: .

272
00:22:14,365 --> 00:22:15,065
Speaker2: made up.

273
00:22:17,805 --> 00:22:18,165
Speaker1: Good.

274
00:22:19,165 --> 00:22:20,805
Speaker1: Right.

275
00:22:21,385 --> 00:22:26,725
Speaker1: .

276
00:22:27,025 --> 00:22:28,665
Speaker2: Yeah.

277
00:22:29,425 --> 00:22:29,825
Speaker1: you

278
00:22:29,625 --> 00:22:34,445
Speaker2: Yeah.

279
00:22:35,045 --> 00:22:36,605
Speaker1: Okay.

280
00:22:37,085 --> 00:22:39,445
Speaker1: um

281
00:22:40,465 --> 00:22:42,845
Speaker1: is

282
00:22:43,345 --> 00:22:43,565
Speaker2: you

283
00:22:43,565 --> 00:22:44,305
Speaker1: Yeah.

284
00:22:45,145 --> 00:22:52,185
Speaker1: Okay.

285
00:22:51,865 --> 00:22:52,125
Speaker2: Yeah. Okay.

286
00:22:52,185 --> 00:22:52,405
Speaker2: you

287
00:22:52,505 --> 00:22:52,945
Speaker2: you

288
00:22:52,945 --> 00:22:55,165
Speaker1: How much rejection did you get in the meantime?

289
00:22:56,425 --> 00:23:02,905
Speaker2: So the rejectives that I received, in a certain extent, are a bit of an issue of, let's call it,

290
00:23:03,445 --> 00:23:10,405
Speaker2: Okay.

291
00:23:10,805 --> 00:23:22,305
Speaker2: um

292
00:23:22,405 --> 00:23:34,325
Speaker2: foreign

293
00:23:34,565 --> 00:23:46,085
Speaker2: um

294
00:23:46,605 --> 00:23:51,605
Speaker2: um

295
00:23:52,105 --> 00:24:06,785
Speaker2: um

296
00:24:07,245 --> 00:24:11,205
Speaker2: After half an hour, he came out with his leg in between his legs and realized he couldn't break my leg.

297
00:24:11,365 --> 00:24:14,545
Speaker2: But was it the guy? I'm also not sure.

298
00:24:14,985 --> 00:24:25,825
Speaker2: Right.

299
00:24:29,025 --> 00:24:29,445
Speaker1: you

300
00:24:30,805 --> 00:24:32,185
Speaker1: Okay.

301
00:24:32,985 --> 00:24:51,045
Speaker2: AI.

302
00:24:51,325 --> 00:24:54,345
Speaker2: and Shiva, who is also very interested in the Talmud.

303
00:24:54,585 --> 00:25:03,665
Speaker2: is

304
00:25:04,065 --> 00:25:05,665
Speaker2: Yeah.

305
00:25:06,225 --> 00:25:11,045
Speaker2: So to start working in a way that's more like it, after the training and the strength of the person, I have about

306
00:25:11,405 --> 00:25:16,605
Speaker2: I

307
00:25:16,965 --> 00:25:23,025
Speaker2: So as soon as there is money in the bank, in good direction, we put their documents and they are inside us for 30 days.

308
00:25:23,465 --> 00:25:24,825
Speaker2: Uh,

309
00:25:25,225 --> 00:25:35,305
Speaker2: .

310
00:25:35,625 --> 00:25:38,345
Speaker2: Gamut Shop Double Regional,

311
00:25:38,485 --> 00:25:42,145
Speaker2: uh

312
00:25:42,145 --> 00:25:43,045
Speaker1: Yeah.

313
00:25:42,445 --> 00:25:43,085
Speaker2: Yeah.

314
00:25:43,085 --> 00:25:43,245
Speaker1: you

315
00:25:43,805 --> 00:25:44,145
Speaker2: Well,

316
00:25:44,605 --> 00:25:45,745
Speaker1: Yeah.

317
00:25:46,205 --> 00:25:48,865
Speaker2: Is that what it is?

318
00:25:49,665 --> 00:25:56,945
Speaker2: Yeah.

319
00:25:57,005 --> 00:26:05,125
Speaker2: It started with a specific device, then it went to stem cell therapy, then to post-traumatic medicine, and so on until it ended at this point.

320
00:26:05,465 --> 00:26:20,625
Speaker2: It's a lot of conversations with people, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations, with organizations,

321
00:26:22,925 --> 00:26:25,785
Speaker1: .

322
00:26:29,345 --> 00:26:31,265
Speaker1: .

323
00:26:32,185 --> 00:26:51,705
Speaker2: Yeah.

324
00:26:52,125 --> 00:27:00,065
Speaker2: It's the large pharma companies that are taking it out of there because they have the money and they don't care to distribute it, because one of the things that is important to them is money, more than anything else.

325
00:27:00,465 --> 00:27:05,805
Speaker2: But all the small companies in the United States have their own

326
00:27:06,245 --> 00:27:18,585
Speaker2: is

327
00:27:19,305 --> 00:27:26,105
Speaker2: It's a full-scale research that is worth a lot of money, both in the field of personal health and in the field of biological research.

328
00:27:26,505 --> 00:27:31,365
Speaker2: which doesn't exist, right? So the perception is that there's an enabler here, in a way,

329
00:27:31,705 --> 00:27:37,425
Speaker2: a

330
00:27:37,945 --> 00:27:41,645
Speaker1: foreign

331
00:27:42,325 --> 00:27:44,145
Speaker1: foreign

332
00:27:44,525 --> 00:27:46,465
Speaker1: Yes.

333
00:27:46,725 --> 00:27:47,085
Speaker2: Yeah.

334
00:27:47,385 --> 00:27:49,245
Speaker1: Let's wait for it. In 15 years,

335
00:27:49,405 --> 00:27:49,905
Speaker2: you

336
00:27:50,145 --> 00:27:51,765
Speaker1: Yes.

337
00:27:52,665 --> 00:27:54,645
Speaker2: Yeshua

338
00:27:54,905 --> 00:28:01,005
Speaker2: FD8

339
00:28:02,605 --> 00:28:14,625
Speaker2: um

340
00:28:14,865 --> 00:28:19,705
Speaker2: The statistic is that 97% of the compounds that work on the receptors don't work.

341
00:28:15,025 --> 00:28:15,345
Speaker1: you

342
00:28:20,285 --> 00:28:24,185
Speaker2: um

343
00:28:24,785 --> 00:28:36,565
Speaker2: um

344
00:28:36,665 --> 00:28:40,545
Speaker2: that contains a large amount of food, and it's really a small piece

345
00:28:41,065 --> 00:28:44,825
Speaker2: And then all the other people say that the image is much bigger.

346
00:28:45,105 --> 00:28:51,305
Speaker2: Because it's really a small piece of human brain. And then the mechanism of the action, how the body works, is much clearer and more clear.

347
00:28:51,625 --> 00:28:57,485
Speaker2: And what FDR says is, put an end to the absurdity of certain vivo, it doesn't work. It's not magical.

348
00:28:57,805 --> 00:28:59,105
Speaker2: Let's move on to the organoids.

349
00:28:59,585 --> 00:29:03,805
Speaker2: And he's already in a situation where today, if you have a component that is proven to be

350
00:29:04,485 --> 00:29:10,925
Speaker2: and you've shown that he works on an organoid, you can send him to a human without any

351
00:29:11,565 --> 00:29:13,925
Speaker2: the

352
00:29:14,325 --> 00:29:19,885
Speaker2: So,

353
00:29:20,205 --> 00:29:25,045
Speaker2: which comes with about 20% in vitro and 80% in vivo, it will turn.

354
00:29:25,605 --> 00:29:28,845
Speaker2: 90% of people will die.

355
00:29:29,145 --> 00:29:33,385
Speaker2: So not only will there be more wetlands,

356
00:29:33,685 --> 00:29:38,025
Speaker2: And my hope is that most of the wet labs in the small companies will not be on-prem.

357
00:29:38,425 --> 00:29:40,985
Speaker2: Yes.

358
00:29:41,845 --> 00:29:44,465
Speaker1: .

359
00:29:44,545 --> 00:29:47,345
Speaker1: Thank you.

360
00:29:48,125 --> 00:29:53,745
Speaker1: which I try to predict ahead of time what works and what doesn't.

361
00:29:54,285 --> 00:29:57,365
Speaker1: um

362
00:29:58,445 --> 00:30:03,385
Speaker1: .

363
00:30:04,225 --> 00:30:06,825
Speaker2: is

364
00:30:06,185 --> 00:30:06,545
Speaker1: you

365
00:30:06,825 --> 00:30:08,445
Speaker1: No,

366
00:30:06,905 --> 00:30:07,385
Speaker2: Right?

367
00:30:08,105 --> 00:30:25,705
Speaker2: Right.

368
00:30:26,185 --> 00:30:30,625
Speaker2: And over time we find that the hard things aren't as hard as chaos and chaos.

369
00:30:30,805 --> 00:30:32,125
Speaker2: which is a little more important.

370
00:30:32,425 --> 00:30:35,245
Speaker2: And the things that are empty are not always empty. There are things that are more...

371
00:30:35,725 --> 00:30:39,305
Speaker2: But you have a lot of friends who are really chaos.

372
00:30:39,645 --> 00:30:43,825
Speaker2: Shoney is very, very important. The two parts are very,

373
00:30:43,905 --> 00:30:59,765
Speaker2: and there's just no ability to make a prediction. But on the other hand, if we're talking about experts in this field, people who have done this, they think it's impossible. They think there's no doubt that there's a lot of value in the in silico. He's using the funnel in a very,

374
00:31:00,005 --> 00:31:06,305
Speaker2: But the observation ability that I have lost, the ability of the simulation that I have lost, that made it difficult for us to build the model,

375
00:31:06,765 --> 00:31:13,465
Speaker2: And that's actually part of the psychological loss, because it's also very happy to put everyone between my eyes during the period of the problem.

376
00:31:13,785 --> 00:31:18,325
Speaker2: Yeah.

377
00:31:18,765 --> 00:31:19,745
Speaker2: Yeah.

378
00:31:19,305 --> 00:31:19,505
Speaker1: you

379
00:31:19,745 --> 00:31:25,385
Speaker1: um

380
00:31:25,565 --> 00:31:26,665
Speaker2: Yeah, I know.

381
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:27,645
Speaker1: you

382
00:31:28,645 --> 00:31:29,345
Speaker1: eh,

383
00:31:30,845 --> 00:31:31,765
Speaker1: the

384
00:31:31,985 --> 00:31:34,885
Speaker1: .

385
00:31:35,505 --> 00:31:36,405
Speaker2: Amish.

386
00:31:38,185 --> 00:31:40,825
Speaker1: And what will you get?

387
00:31:41,285 --> 00:31:55,725
Speaker2: um

388
00:31:54,945 --> 00:31:57,005
Speaker1: What you see today...

389
00:31:58,345 --> 00:32:00,365
Speaker1: .

390
00:32:00,365 --> 00:32:00,665
Speaker2: you

391
00:32:00,805 --> 00:32:31,105
Speaker2: What?

392
00:32:22,145 --> 00:32:22,245
Speaker1: you

393
00:32:31,425 --> 00:32:35,685
Speaker2: And it's a service that already today, they're paying between half a million to a million.

394
00:32:36,305 --> 00:32:38,565
Speaker2: Right.

395
00:32:40,085 --> 00:32:42,605
Speaker1: um

396
00:32:43,205 --> 00:32:52,665
Speaker2: So what's happening today, for all intents and purposes, we're talking specifically about the sartanic, because it's the easiest and best solution in this process. We're taking an example from the Great and the Great.

397
00:32:52,985 --> 00:33:09,705
Speaker2: is

398
00:33:01,225 --> 00:33:01,405
Speaker1: you

399
00:33:10,125 --> 00:33:10,645
Speaker2: you

400
00:33:11,125 --> 00:33:20,765
Speaker2: .

401
00:33:20,965 --> 00:33:33,085
Speaker2: It's a new value or not a new value. We will, in a way, make some drugs that are healthy.

402
00:33:33,565 --> 00:33:37,625
Speaker2: It's a long time since I discovered that certain drugs for epilepsy are

403
00:33:40,845 --> 00:33:47,145
Speaker2: So that's kind of the random phase that helps us in this process, because we don't have idle time for machines. We can just always develop compounds.

404
00:33:48,285 --> 00:33:52,805
Speaker1: Why do you need two working systems? You're a service, you don't know how many systems

405
00:33:53,265 --> 00:34:07,605
Speaker2: um

406
00:34:08,045 --> 00:34:16,625
Speaker2: is

407
00:34:16,865 --> 00:34:23,505
Speaker2: .

408
00:34:26,285 --> 00:34:31,165
Speaker1: .

409
00:34:31,905 --> 00:34:33,905
Speaker1: um

410
00:34:34,665 --> 00:34:35,905
Speaker1: No shit.

411
00:34:36,385 --> 00:34:45,805
Speaker2: Right.

412
00:34:44,605 --> 00:34:49,205
Speaker1: Yeah.

413
00:34:49,645 --> 00:34:53,545
Speaker1: is

414
00:34:52,105 --> 00:34:52,365
Speaker2: you

415
00:34:53,685 --> 00:35:07,985
Speaker2: um

416
00:35:07,185 --> 00:35:08,645
Speaker1: Thank you.

417
00:35:08,885 --> 00:35:12,665
Speaker2: service.

418
00:35:12,125 --> 00:35:12,365
Speaker1: you

419
00:35:12,665 --> 00:35:15,565
Speaker1: But I'll say it again. I don't want to get too much into it,

420
00:35:15,685 --> 00:35:18,265
Speaker2: service service no time for service and it's not a

421
00:35:17,405 --> 00:35:18,845
Speaker1: Absolutely.

422
00:35:19,065 --> 00:35:19,445
Speaker2: you

423
00:35:19,705 --> 00:35:21,085
Speaker1: Wow.

424
00:35:21,085 --> 00:35:29,145
Speaker2: Right.

425
00:35:29,485 --> 00:35:30,925
Speaker2: So the film

426
00:35:31,325 --> 00:35:37,625
Speaker2: um

427
00:35:37,905 --> 00:35:39,745
Speaker2: is

428
00:35:40,985 --> 00:35:46,525
Speaker2: That means, even in this situation, this machine can call it a top service for processes that are

429
00:35:47,225 --> 00:35:49,725
Speaker2: I just want to make sure that at all levels

430
00:35:53,245 --> 00:35:54,985
Speaker1: Okay.

431
00:35:56,265 --> 00:35:58,165
Speaker1: as

432
00:35:58,725 --> 00:35:59,705
Speaker1: fish

433
00:36:00,565 --> 00:36:01,325
Speaker2: I don't know.

434
00:36:01,605 --> 00:36:02,045
Speaker1: Okay.

435
00:36:02,225 --> 00:36:11,265
Speaker2: Right.

436
00:36:11,405 --> 00:36:19,665
Speaker2: um

437
00:36:20,185 --> 00:36:24,245
Speaker2: foreign

438
00:36:24,945 --> 00:36:27,105
Speaker2: and really scale up the network.

439
00:36:32,425 --> 00:36:34,145
Speaker1: I

440
00:36:34,885 --> 00:36:49,545
Speaker2: I would love to have relevant design partners. I might close a few small and specific businesses to see if there is any kind of revenue. I would like a pipeline that is able to receive the service within the process. I am ready to read the accounts

441
00:36:49,905 --> 00:37:01,365
Speaker2: um

442
00:37:01,365 --> 00:37:05,885
Speaker1: foreign

443
00:37:06,905 --> 00:37:23,665
Speaker2: So,

444
00:37:23,165 --> 00:37:24,325
Speaker1: Like, I'm a little bit scared.

445
00:37:25,085 --> 00:37:28,585
Speaker1: .

446
00:37:29,105 --> 00:37:35,485
Speaker1: foreign

447
00:37:35,025 --> 00:37:35,725
Speaker2: you

448
00:37:35,925 --> 00:37:40,105
Speaker2: You're right. There's also this idea of, let's call it...

449
00:37:40,125 --> 00:37:50,965
Speaker2: Shoney Benolamot, Shieyem Ainein Lirot Oto. Ki im karega, Rom Meshki Mishimu Ehez Zajeneralistim, Kade L'Avim Ta Hazon Zat Fisa, Meshki Hayay Hayab Niyot Bo Mishuk, Neyam Mishimu Pachot Echad Me Meshki,

450
00:37:51,305 --> 00:38:04,885
Speaker2: This is the language that is really used in medical science.

451
00:38:05,325 --> 00:38:11,885
Speaker2: um

452
00:38:12,265 --> 00:38:27,765
Speaker2: And also there, it's a question of which investment they have. There's a difference between talking to Pfizer, Merck, or investment firms in this way, and talking to them in a different way during this process. But even if I had to talk to AliveBC, which is an investment that entered the A-RAM, they would have talked about revenue that was there,

453
00:38:27,865 --> 00:38:30,745
Speaker2: Now, revenue of $3 million is $3.2 billion.

454
00:38:31,625 --> 00:38:37,585
Speaker2: is

455
00:38:37,865 --> 00:38:39,245
Speaker1: .

456
00:38:39,905 --> 00:38:40,285
Speaker2: I

457
00:38:40,705 --> 00:38:47,505
Speaker2: Shela, I can tell you that we talk about three businesses of choice, like Crown Barrier, we both understand that it doesn't raise the price.

458
00:38:48,305 --> 00:38:48,805
Speaker1: you

459
00:38:48,425 --> 00:38:52,765
Speaker2: It's to create a specific service and a specific lock that I can close in front of

460
00:38:53,925 --> 00:38:57,725
Speaker1: foreign

461
00:38:58,325 --> 00:39:01,145
Speaker1: .

462
00:39:02,005 --> 00:39:02,605
Speaker1: you

463
00:39:03,085 --> 00:39:05,765
Speaker1: um

464
00:39:06,765 --> 00:39:07,585
Speaker1: Okay.

465
00:39:07,985 --> 00:39:10,405
Speaker2: You say. It's a good question. What do you think? What do you think?

466
00:39:11,685 --> 00:39:15,685
Speaker1: um

467
00:39:16,245 --> 00:39:20,225
Speaker1: um

468
00:39:21,425 --> 00:39:28,405
Speaker1: um

469
00:39:27,925 --> 00:39:28,265
Speaker2: the president.

470
00:39:29,085 --> 00:39:29,725
Speaker1: you

471
00:39:30,405 --> 00:39:34,505
Speaker1: I think that what you have to miss in my case is that it's much more important

472
00:39:34,965 --> 00:39:36,385
Speaker1: is

473
00:39:37,865 --> 00:39:40,645
Speaker1: See ya.

474
00:39:41,405 --> 00:39:41,825
Speaker1: you

475
00:39:42,525 --> 00:39:45,565
Speaker1: .

476
00:39:45,805 --> 00:39:45,885
Speaker1: you

477
00:39:45,885 --> 00:39:46,165
Speaker2: Good.

478
00:39:46,165 --> 00:39:46,225
Speaker1: you

479
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:51,885
Speaker1: Yes, you're in a very backward situation where you need a little more money.

480
00:39:52,445 --> 00:39:53,645
Speaker1: That's a gumbo.

481
00:39:54,085 --> 00:39:54,505
Speaker2: you

482
00:39:54,665 --> 00:39:57,945
Speaker1: Yeah.

483
00:39:58,365 --> 00:40:00,865
Speaker1: Hi.

484
00:39:58,665 --> 00:39:59,105
Speaker2: Right.

485
00:40:01,045 --> 00:40:01,525
Speaker2: you

486
00:40:01,525 --> 00:40:06,045
Speaker1: Right.

487
00:40:06,645 --> 00:40:10,525
Speaker1: I mean, you put the needle on the side, the chance is that you just don't get it, right?

488
00:40:11,025 --> 00:40:13,705
Speaker1: my source is the intermediate funding

489
00:40:13,205 --> 00:40:13,425
Speaker2: you

490
00:40:14,645 --> 00:40:18,545
Speaker1: to under-promise and overachieve.

491
00:40:19,305 --> 00:40:23,665
Speaker1: um

492
00:40:24,085 --> 00:40:25,265
Speaker1: Yes.

493
00:40:26,005 --> 00:40:27,905
Speaker2: in the wind.

494
00:40:27,485 --> 00:40:30,305
Speaker1: .

495
00:40:30,765 --> 00:40:32,705
Speaker1: Yeah.

496
00:40:33,165 --> 00:40:33,585
Speaker1: you

497
00:40:34,885 --> 00:40:39,925
Speaker1: You can do multiple ways.

498
00:40:36,365 --> 00:40:36,785
Speaker2: you

499
00:40:40,205 --> 00:40:41,685
Speaker1: That I'm besotted.

500
00:40:41,965 --> 00:40:43,245
Speaker1: Please see it.

501
00:40:43,625 --> 00:40:44,625
Speaker1: him.

502
00:40:45,405 --> 00:40:52,865
Speaker1: C, the seed extension, all these processes allow us to have much better accuracy. They are less visible as a failure, let's call it that.

503
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:54,405
Speaker1: Okay.

504
00:40:54,445 --> 00:40:57,765
Speaker1: But I think what's really important is

505
00:40:54,765 --> 00:40:55,205
Speaker2: do.

506
00:40:58,245 --> 00:41:06,345
Speaker1: um

507
00:41:02,445 --> 00:41:02,905
Speaker2: you

508
00:41:06,925 --> 00:41:08,745
Speaker1: I don't wish to move on

509
00:41:08,985 --> 00:41:11,805
Speaker1: promising

510
00:41:12,045 --> 00:41:12,345
Speaker1: you

511
00:41:12,725 --> 00:41:14,665
Speaker1: Yeah.

512
00:41:16,105 --> 00:41:23,785
Speaker1: and good alignment, and that puts you in a good place. But I mainly want to hear from them what they expect to see in the

513
00:41:24,365 --> 00:41:24,985
Speaker2: you

514
00:41:25,685 --> 00:41:26,945
Speaker2: Yeah.

515
00:41:26,945 --> 00:41:30,165
Speaker1: is

516
00:41:30,525 --> 00:41:33,745
Speaker1: .

517
00:41:34,225 --> 00:41:42,405
Speaker2: I can tell you that what I heard from the people I got to, like at IDC, who are more specific in their

518
00:41:42,705 --> 00:41:44,525
Speaker2: .

519
00:41:45,005 --> 00:41:49,345
Speaker2: So

520
00:41:49,945 --> 00:41:50,845
Speaker2: That's it?

521
00:41:51,005 --> 00:42:00,705
Speaker2: parma and medical device

522
00:42:00,885 --> 00:42:00,905
Speaker2: you

523
00:42:00,905 --> 00:42:01,165
Speaker1: is better.

524
00:42:01,165 --> 00:42:04,285
Speaker2: And that's really kind of why it's much louder than it is at the USA.

525
00:42:01,225 --> 00:42:01,265
Speaker1: you

526
00:42:04,565 --> 00:42:11,825
Speaker2: you don't have anything other than a device that is in some kind of a cold body and does something. You don't prove any serious injuries or anything.

527
00:42:12,265 --> 00:42:16,465
Speaker2: safety

528
00:42:16,885 --> 00:42:21,585
Speaker2: And so what I talked to companies that are more related to the field is the idea

529
00:42:21,805 --> 00:42:27,085
Speaker2: The perspective of the mechanism is that it's a retrospective of one.

530
00:42:27,205 --> 00:42:31,585
Speaker2: You're talking for a while, the technology is very interesting, it looks relevant, we want to see

531
00:42:32,425 --> 00:42:33,805
Speaker1: Yeah.

532
00:42:35,285 --> 00:42:39,465
Speaker1: um

533
00:42:39,945 --> 00:42:41,245
Speaker1: um

534
00:42:41,525 --> 00:42:41,545
Speaker1: you

535
00:42:41,545 --> 00:42:41,665
Speaker2: you

536
00:42:41,665 --> 00:42:44,465
Speaker1: the whole piece. It is

537
00:42:41,705 --> 00:42:41,905
Speaker2: you

538
00:42:44,925 --> 00:42:45,465
Speaker2: Yeah.

539
00:42:45,465 --> 00:42:48,485
Speaker1: Yes, you can put two of them on one side, and the second point needs to be

540
00:42:48,945 --> 00:42:51,645
Speaker1: is

541
00:42:51,645 --> 00:42:52,365
Speaker2: Shalom.

542
00:42:51,665 --> 00:42:52,125
Speaker1: Shalom.

543
00:42:52,865 --> 00:42:53,505
Speaker2: there.

544
00:42:53,645 --> 00:42:54,165
Speaker1: Okay.

545
00:42:54,265 --> 00:42:59,925
Speaker1: You can play the game, but most of the people

546
00:42:57,925 --> 00:42:58,225
Speaker2: played the game kind of a

547
00:43:00,505 --> 00:43:02,245
Speaker1: So from a general standpoint,

548
00:43:02,945 --> 00:43:09,185
Speaker1: might want to actually acquire you, and they need to know that they're acquiring an asset, and not a project, and they don't want to invest in R&D.

549
00:43:09,425 --> 00:43:09,865
Speaker2: you

550
00:43:10,125 --> 00:43:10,585
Speaker1: you

551
00:43:10,745 --> 00:43:13,005
Speaker1: which is fine as an option, but not as a plan.

552
00:43:13,885 --> 00:43:14,585
Speaker1: And

553
00:43:14,685 --> 00:43:15,165
Speaker2: That's okay.

554
00:43:16,145 --> 00:43:16,845
Speaker1: you

555
00:43:17,305 --> 00:43:18,945
Speaker1: Um,

556
00:43:19,385 --> 00:43:21,225
Speaker1: foreign

557
00:43:22,305 --> 00:43:36,925
Speaker2: um

558
00:43:37,625 --> 00:43:44,005
Speaker2: To the leader.

559
00:43:44,185 --> 00:43:50,505
Speaker2: And for that I need this fund. Because if I now raise a million dollars, two million dollars, which I already have,

560
00:43:50,885 --> 00:44:02,665
Speaker2: um

561
00:44:02,965 --> 00:44:09,885
Speaker2: You understand? Because we're talking about some machine, and I'm still not there. That's my fear. The price.

562
00:44:10,365 --> 00:44:14,465
Speaker2: uh

563
00:44:14,905 --> 00:44:16,385
Speaker2: um

564
00:44:17,365 --> 00:44:20,885
Speaker2: So that's my thoughts and concerns

565
00:44:21,085 --> 00:44:28,365
Speaker2: So first of all, I'll try your thoughts. It's another thing to know, to keep your thoughts, to see what you're doing and to see what you're doing.

566
00:44:30,845 --> 00:44:32,705
Speaker1: Thank you very much.

567
00:44:33,505 --> 00:44:44,905
Speaker2: So if we're talking about the first market, it's $1.5 billion. The market we're continuing on is $66 billion, and we're constantly receiving feedback that we're missing about the same amount.

568
00:44:45,305 --> 00:44:49,165
Speaker2: שזה הגיוני כי שוק הפרמה כלל הוא 2.4 טריליון דולר

569
00:44:49,545 --> 00:45:00,845
Speaker2: and the food market is 400 trillion dollars. So the numbers we get are a little bit small, the market movements are small, but I recommend again to underprivileged

570
00:45:02,045 --> 00:45:02,365
Speaker1: you

571
00:45:04,825 --> 00:45:10,145
Speaker1: um

572
00:45:11,305 --> 00:45:15,325
Speaker1: um

573
00:45:16,065 --> 00:45:16,765
Speaker1: you

574
00:45:18,285 --> 00:45:22,745
Speaker1: foreign

575
00:45:23,105 --> 00:45:23,305
Speaker1: you

576
00:45:23,645 --> 00:45:24,345
Speaker1: Mm-hmm.

577
00:45:26,885 --> 00:45:28,005
Speaker1: I think it's possible.

578
00:45:28,345 --> 00:45:29,145
Speaker1: and

579
00:45:31,765 --> 00:45:36,965
Speaker1: .

580
00:45:37,525 --> 00:45:41,665
Speaker1: um

581
00:45:43,345 --> 00:45:47,145
Speaker1: um

582
00:45:45,745 --> 00:45:46,065
Speaker2: Yeah.

583
00:45:47,285 --> 00:45:47,785
Speaker1: you

584
00:45:47,925 --> 00:45:49,265
Speaker1: And that's because

585
00:45:49,505 --> 00:45:51,805
Speaker1: is

586
00:45:51,845 --> 00:45:53,365
Speaker1: to

587
00:45:54,165 --> 00:45:57,365
Speaker1: science

588
00:45:57,785 --> 00:46:02,025
Speaker1: .

589
00:46:02,125 --> 00:46:06,385
Speaker1: foreign

590
00:46:06,605 --> 00:46:12,765
Speaker1: um

591
00:46:06,885 --> 00:46:06,965
Speaker2: you

592
00:46:13,485 --> 00:46:17,785
Speaker1: Not very much. Both robotics and DeeperTech.

593
00:46:18,125 --> 00:46:21,745
Speaker1: .

594
00:46:22,065 --> 00:46:23,165
Speaker1: Amen.

595
00:46:23,605 --> 00:46:31,465
Speaker1: First meeting.

596
00:46:31,785 --> 00:46:34,825
Speaker1: Yeah.

597
00:46:32,085 --> 00:46:32,105
Speaker2: you

598
00:46:35,925 --> 00:46:37,665
Speaker1: um

599
00:46:37,885 --> 00:46:43,605
Speaker1: um

600
00:46:38,165 --> 00:46:38,325
Speaker2: you

601
00:46:42,345 --> 00:46:42,425
Speaker2: you

602
00:46:44,205 --> 00:46:44,805
Speaker1: you

603
00:46:46,065 --> 00:46:53,865
Speaker1: But I'll give them... You know, I don't even know if I'll give them anything. I think it's better to just think about it before you get to the point.

604
00:46:54,805 --> 00:46:59,765
Speaker1: .

605
00:47:01,505 --> 00:47:02,265
Speaker1: And

606
00:47:02,565 --> 00:47:06,545
Speaker1: um

607
00:47:05,425 --> 00:47:05,605
Speaker2: you

608
00:47:07,485 --> 00:47:09,785
Speaker1: raising your A successfully

609
00:47:09,565 --> 00:47:09,645
Speaker2: you

610
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:09,885
Speaker2: you

611
00:47:10,245 --> 00:47:14,785
Speaker1: um

612
00:47:15,185 --> 00:47:19,705
Speaker1: um

613
00:47:19,705 --> 00:47:20,065
Speaker2: I don't see anything on the screen.

614
00:47:20,265 --> 00:47:21,125
Speaker1: the achievable

615
00:47:21,405 --> 00:47:21,725
Speaker2: you

616
00:47:21,725 --> 00:47:29,105
Speaker1: Yes.

617
00:47:29,325 --> 00:47:29,865
Speaker2: you

618
00:47:30,365 --> 00:47:34,705
Speaker1: .

619
00:47:34,145 --> 00:47:37,345
Speaker2: I'm very happy with the connection. It seems very relevant to me.

620
00:47:37,685 --> 00:47:42,005
Speaker1: Just a lot of shots that were explained that maybe it's enough to...

621
00:47:42,845 --> 00:47:47,985
Speaker1: You will probably be dealing with similar challenges, or even more challenging challenges, by the way.

622
00:47:48,305 --> 00:47:48,825
Speaker2: you

623
00:47:48,825 --> 00:47:49,425
Speaker1: Yeah.

624
00:47:49,085 --> 00:47:56,365
Speaker2: um

625
00:47:56,445 --> 00:48:14,585
Speaker2: um

626
00:48:14,885 --> 00:48:16,265
Speaker2: But you can do

627
00:48:15,245 --> 00:48:17,745
Speaker1: I have an idea.

628
00:48:18,285 --> 00:48:22,405
Speaker1: um

629
00:48:22,405 --> 00:48:22,645
Speaker2: you

630
00:48:22,645 --> 00:48:22,725
Speaker1: you

631
00:48:22,785 --> 00:48:26,725
Speaker1: After you do this, the chances are 40%. Right now, when

632
00:48:25,065 --> 00:48:25,485
Speaker2: you

633
00:48:27,125 --> 00:48:29,085
Speaker1: much much less than that, okay?

634
00:48:28,625 --> 00:48:28,745
Speaker2: you

635
00:48:29,365 --> 00:48:33,645
Speaker1: um

636
00:48:34,465 --> 00:48:35,205
Speaker1: But it

637
00:48:35,505 --> 00:48:36,085
Speaker1: Please.

638
00:48:36,225 --> 00:48:38,545
Speaker1: You know what I'm saying?

639
00:48:38,025 --> 00:48:38,365
Speaker2: you

640
00:48:39,025 --> 00:48:41,185
Speaker1: foreign

641
00:48:41,625 --> 00:48:41,825
Speaker2: you

642
00:48:41,825 --> 00:48:46,585
Speaker1: .

643
00:48:41,865 --> 00:48:42,125
Speaker2: rolling.

644
00:48:46,705 --> 00:48:46,725
Speaker1: you

645
00:48:46,725 --> 00:48:56,465
Speaker2: Yeah.

646
00:48:46,865 --> 00:48:47,205
Speaker1: No,

647
00:48:56,505 --> 00:48:58,285
Speaker2: Wow.

648
00:48:56,745 --> 00:48:57,205
Speaker1: Boom.

649
00:48:58,165 --> 00:49:02,025
Speaker1: foreign

650
00:49:02,365 --> 00:49:04,845
Speaker1: Yes.

651
00:49:04,985 --> 00:49:05,285
Speaker2: Yeah.

652
00:49:05,285 --> 00:49:09,005
Speaker1: foreign

653
00:49:05,325 --> 00:49:06,085
Speaker2: That's a bit too early.

654
00:49:09,405 --> 00:49:09,885
Speaker2: you

655
00:49:09,885 --> 00:49:16,545
Speaker1: .

656
00:49:16,965 --> 00:49:17,605
Speaker1: Tata Katot!

657
00:49:18,125 --> 00:49:22,545
Speaker1: First of all, it's the good of society. First of all, our good and your good as well.

658
00:49:22,385 --> 00:49:22,965
Speaker2: you

659
00:49:23,145 --> 00:49:23,325
Speaker2: you

660
00:49:23,325 --> 00:49:23,665
Speaker1: you

661
00:49:23,365 --> 00:49:27,385
Speaker2: um

662
00:49:27,885 --> 00:49:34,705
Speaker1: So we're going to do it this way, and only after the social welfare is over can we talk about the welfare of the government, the welfare of the economy,

663
00:49:35,065 --> 00:49:38,345
Speaker1: .

664
00:49:39,265 --> 00:49:40,145
Speaker1: Um,

665
00:49:40,985 --> 00:49:45,925
Speaker1: Okay. So I, if you want, I'll check with the B.Y. CEO if he's ready to

666
00:49:45,925 --> 00:49:47,085
Speaker2: I would love to.

667
00:49:47,885 --> 00:49:53,845
Speaker1: um

668
00:49:54,565 --> 00:49:55,305
Speaker1: And

669
00:49:56,005 --> 00:50:00,385
Speaker1: um

670
00:50:00,705 --> 00:50:01,305
Speaker1: Yeah.

671
00:50:00,885 --> 00:50:01,285
Speaker2: Yeah.

672
00:50:01,305 --> 00:50:12,105
Speaker2: I'll do my homework because I know I'm ready before that. The meeting with the president will be as quick as possible. It will help me in the process. And I'll be back. I'll be back.

673
00:50:01,705 --> 00:50:01,885
Speaker1: you

674
00:50:11,365 --> 00:50:13,165
Speaker1: So it's going to start.

675
00:50:13,165 --> 00:50:13,545
Speaker2: you

676
00:50:13,665 --> 00:50:21,665
Speaker1: um

677
00:50:19,325 --> 00:50:19,545
